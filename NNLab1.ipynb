        "3. **Stability Through Retraining:**\n",
        "   - The stability of these representations through retraining depends on various factors such as the dataset, network architecture, hyperparameters, and initialization.\n",
        "   - Generally, lower layers (such as Conv1) tend to exhibit more stable representations since they capture fundamental features present in the input images.\n",
        "   - Higher layers (such as Conv2) may show more variability in representations as they learn to combine lower-level features and adapt to the specific characteristics of the training data.\n",
        "   - Dropout regularization, if applied, may introduce additional variability in representations during training, but it helps improve the overall robustness and generalization of the network."
